# Summer School on Data Science Tools and Techniques in Modelling Complex Networks

### [Bogumił Kamiński](http://bogumilkaminski.pl/about/)

## Introduction to Julia language with applications to machine learning
### Day 1, Monday, August 19th, 2019, 13:00 to 16:00

**Objective**: Provide an overview of the Julia programming language on a
real example (MNIST dataset).

[The Julia Express](http://bogumilkaminski.pl/files/julia_express.pdf)
is a recommended reading before the workshop to get
a general feeling of the Julia language.

All files needed for this part are stored in `day1` folder.

After installing Julia You can run `julia 1_prepareenv.jl` command from system
shell in the `day1` directory before the workshop
(this will load and install all required packages).

## Working with graph data using Julia Language
### Day 2, Tuesday, August 20th, 2019, 13:00 to 16:00

**Objective**: Provide an introduction to working with graphs in
the Julia programming language. Give numerical examples building intuition
before analytical part of the workshop presented by Pawel Pralat.

All files needed for this part are stored in `day1` folder.

After installing Julia You can run `julia 1_prepareenv.jl` command from system
shell in the `day2` directory before the workshop
(this will load and install all required packages).
